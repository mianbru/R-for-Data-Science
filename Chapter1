"1.1) Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?"
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)
	*should see scatter plot showing relationship between engine displacement and highway mpg.

"1.2) how many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?"
	> ?mtcars
	*mtcars has 32 rows and 11 columns.

"1.3) What does the drv variable describe? Read help for mpg to find out."
	> ?mpg
	*drv describes the drive type of the car e.g. front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, 4-wheel drive.

"1.4) Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl."
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))

"1.5) What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful."
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
	*This plot is not useful because these two variables have no effect on one another, therefore showing their relationship provides 	no insight.

------------------------------------------------Exercise 2------------------------------------------------

"1.1) Whats gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
	* the code above puts color within the aesthetic mapping, when it should be outside.
	
"1.2)Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? (Hint: type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?
	*Manufacture, model, trans, drv, fl, and class are all categorical. displ, yearr, cyl, cty, and hwy are continuous. we can see this info by running mpg and looking at the data.

"1.3) Map a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical versus continuous?
	*color creates a spectrum for continuous variables, size operates similarly, and shape cannot be used with continuous variables.

"1.4) What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?
	*If you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics it applies all the aesthetics to the same variable.

"1.5) What does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)
	*The stroke aesthetic modifies the width of the shape's border.
"1.6) What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(color = displ < 5)?
	*If you map an aesthetic to a conditional statement, the data will be colored on a true false basis.
