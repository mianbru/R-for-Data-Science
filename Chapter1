"1.1) Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?"
			> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)
			*should see scatter plot showing relationship between engine displacement and highway mpg.

"1.2) how many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?"
			> ?mtcars
			*mtcars has 32 rows and 11 columns.

"1.3) What does the drv variable describe? Read help for mpg to find out."
			> ?mpg
			*drv describes the drive type of the car e.g. front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, 4-wheel drive.

"1.4) Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl."
			> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
