"1.1) Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?"
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)
	*should see scatter plot showing relationship between engine displacement and highway mpg.

"1.2) how many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?"
	> ?mtcars
	*mtcars has 32 rows and 11 columns.

"1.3) What does the drv variable describe? Read help for mpg to find out."
	> ?mpg
	*drv describes the drive type of the car e.g. front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, 4-wheel drive.

"1.4) Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl."
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))

"1.5) What happens if you make a scatterplot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful."
	> ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
	*This plot is not useful because these two variables have no effect on one another, therefore showing their relationship provides 	no insight.
